# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

My name is Rob Kelly and this is my first User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project.
For this project I have chosen to create a personal portfolio site to help promote myself and
my skills and talent to any potential employers or collegues to collaborate on projects together.
 
I will provide credits for any links or work used.

## UX

As stated above, I am creating a personal portfolio for myself. The purpose of this site is to display my skills and value for
potential employers as well as possible collegues and other developers that may want to colaborate on future projects.

I plan to achieve this by using a minimalist tile approach for a nice clean, easy to use user experience.

I believe by having a nice, easy to use site like this it will show the user a little bit about who I am and what I can offer if they wish to work with me.

## Features

My personal website is a minimalist approach which I feel gives the user a nice, easy to use yet pleasing to the eye experience. I have added three different sub-pages that the user can navigate to using the menu in the header at the top (or directory at in the footer at the bottom of the site).
I have an about me page just giving a brief intoduction into who I am. I also have a work history page to show relevant info on how I got to where I am with coding today. Lastly, I have a contact page where the user can contact me if they require any further info or general queries. 

### Existing Features
* Feature 1 - Contact page - Allows users to contact me, by having them fill out the contact details and clicking submit.
* Feature 2 - Social icons - Allows any potential employers or collaborators to check out my online presence by clicking any of the social icons at the bottom of the footer on each page.
* Feature 3 - Home page - Allows users to see right away what programming skills I may have to offer, without having to navigate very far into the site.

### Features Left to Implement

* In future I would like to add links to any project work I have done or possibly add a project page.

## Technologies Used

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/overview/)

    * This project uses Bootstrap as it is a great toolkit for setting up mobile-first web pages.

* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)

    * This project uses JQuery to help assist with Bootstrap.

* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

    * This project uses font awesome to replace the default fonts used.

## Testing

{In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.}

{Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.}

{For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:}

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

{In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.}

{You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.}

{If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.}

## Deployment

To deploy my project I am using GitHub Pages to host, working from my master branch.

* I started by going to github.com and logging into my account.
* Using the settings tab in the upper menu I scrolled down to "Source" in the "Github Pages" section.
* By default it was set to none so I selected "Master Branch" and waited for the sie to deploy.
* Once complete I clocked the link to make sure that my site was opening in my browser.

To run this code simply, 

* Go to [github.com](https://github.com/1208kelly/user_centric_frontend_milestone_project_rk)
* From here using the "clone of download" button, you can download a copy of my porject to your desktop.
* On this same page is also a "Gitpod button", you can use this to view my project in Gitpod.
